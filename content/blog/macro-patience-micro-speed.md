Buzzwords? Maybe. I wouldn't be surprised, given how widespread
[Gary Vaynerchuk's](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/) message has become over the
last few years. I used to consume GaryVee content by the gallon. It wasn't the
entrepreneur lifestyle that was attractive. It wasn't the allure of building
businesses that lead to riches aplenty. I could give two shits.

I was drawn to his work ethic. Some would call it _hustle_. Confirmed buzzword.
A younger me needed to see that such focus could be deployed in other
environments outside of organized sports. So I read, I watched and I listened to
the man drive the same message down my throat for weeks and months. Eventually I
hopped off his train of content. I took what I needed. Left behind what I
didn't.

The biggest takeaway was
[_Macro Patience, Micro Speed_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFzPuEEvnDU).
Gary uses this phrase in the context of business development. That is not my
arena, but it's such a powerful idea that it trancends into everyday life.

I interpret this phrase as having the courage to pursue difficult things, the
intelligence to construct a blueprint to aid you, the unrelenting tenacity to
execute it every day, and the fortitude to endure the unattractive timeframe of
it all.
