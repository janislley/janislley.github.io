The `v16.6.0` release of React includes some highly anticipated features such as
native support for dynamic imports and memoization for function components. This
is a big release for the library and community at large. Some of these features
will have a major impact on how we compose UI moving forward.

This post will focus on covering the features I find most intriguing:

- `React.lazy`
- `React.Suspense`
- `React.memo`
- `static contextType`

Let's dive in!

## `React.lazy`

The term **lazy loading** has been around for a while, and the idea is pretty
simple: _to load some slice of code when it's needed._ It is a technique used in
**code splitting**, which involves breaking up your app into separate bundles
which can be loaded on demand.

With the `React.lazy` API, you can now load components _dynamically_ - only when
they need to render.

```jsx
import React, {lazy} from 'react'

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'))
```

`React.lazy` takes a function that returns a dynamic import. The module being
imported
[must have a default export containing a React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy).

In the example above, `LazyComponent` is not an actual component..._yet_. It's a
dynamic import that can be rendered in your JSX as if it _were_ a component.

```jsx
import React, {lazy} from 'react'

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'))

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LazyComponent />
    </div>
  )
}
```

When `App` renders, `LazyComponent` will be loaded in a separate bundle. But
what happens if it hasn't loaded by the time `App` is finished rendering?

```
Error: An update was suspended, but no placeholder UI was provided.
```

That happens. Not ideal. Luckily, there is a simple solution in the form of
`React.Suspense`.

## `React.Suspense`

To prevent the error above from happening, you can wrap a lazy component in the
new `React.Suspense` component, which provides some fallback UI to show while
the component loads.

```jsx
import React, {lazy, Suspense} from 'react'

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'))

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

`React.Suspense` requires a single `fallback` prop, and its value should be a
React element you wish to show while a dynamically imported component is being
loaded.

You don't need to render a `React.Suspense` component _directly above_ a
lazy-loaded component. Instead, React will look for the closest `React.Suspense`
parent and use its fallback UI.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <div>
    <div>
      <LazyComponent />
    </div>
  </div>
</Suspense>
```

Another cool feature about `React.Suspense` is that it can be used to wrap
multiple components being dynamically imported with `React.lazy`. It's not
limited to just one.

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyOne />
  <LazyTwo />
</Suspense>
```

There is a clear synergy between `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`. You could
have done dynamic importing before with something like `webpack`, but it wasn't
baked into React itself. The APIs are super friendly too, and together they
should make code splitting more approachable.

## `React.memo`

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization),
**memoization** is an optimization technique that stores the results of
expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs
occur again.

My introduction to memoization happened with the Redux library
[`reselect`](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect). In `reselect` there is a
`createSelector` function which optimizes expensive calculations that rely on
inputs from a Redux store. If you're not familiar with memoization then I
encourage you to take a look at the
[Motivation for Memoized Selectors](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect#motivation-for-memoized-selectors)
section of the `reselect` docs. Consider it required reading. üìö

So what does this mean in the context of React? Up until this point, function
components in React re-render _every time_ their parent renders, even if their
prop values haven't changed. To solve this, React `v16.6` introduces a new
higher-order component called `React.memo`. You use it the same way you would
use any higher-order component in React, _except_ it is only to be used on
function components.

```jsx
import React, {memo} from 'react'

const MemoizeMeCaptain = ({prop1, prop2}) => <h1>Get it!</h1>

export default memo(MemoizeMeCaptain)
```

If `MemoizeMeCaptain` receives the same values for `prop1` and `prop2`, it will
not re-render. This is a performance optimization and should be used in the same
way you would use `React.PureComponent` for class components. You can even
provide your own
[comparison function](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) as the
second argument to `React.memo` if you want more control.

Egghead.io has a great
[free lesson](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-react-memo-with-a-function-component-to-get-purecomponent-behavior)
on how to use `React.memo` by [Elijah Manor](https://twitter.com/elijahmanor).
It's definitely worth a look! üëÄ

## `static contextType`

The last new feature I want to touch on is `static contextType`, which is a new
way of subscribing to context in class components. If you're not familiar with
context in React, the [official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#api)
are a great introduction.

Consuming context in a component requires you to use a
[render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). I never really had a
problem with this method, but I can definitely understand the argument that it
creates unnecessary nesting and muddies up the component tree.

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider>
      {context => (
        <h1>{context.value}</h1>
      )}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

In React `v16.6` the `static contextType` can be used on class components to
consume context without requiring you to use render props at all!

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  static contextType = MyContext

  render() {
    return <h1>{this.context.value}</h1>
  }
}
```

`this.context` is also accessible in lifecycle methods, which is a major quality
of life adjustment. Before, you'd have to jump through hoops to consume context
in those methods.

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  static contextType = MyContext

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.context.value)
  }
  // ...
}
```

The only drawback I've found with this feature, and one that is mentioned in the
[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#classcontexttype), is that
you can only consume _a single_ context. That being said, there are
[creative workarounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#consuming-multiple-contexts)
for those who need it.

### A quick note on `static` properties

I've touched on `static` properties in
[a previous article](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/compound-component-basics/#code-static-code-properties).
One important takeaway from that article, and one that still holds true, is that
you can only use `static` properties in React class components if you're using
[`@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties).
For you `create-react-app` users, this feature is
[enabled by default](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features#supported-language-features).
üëçüèª

If you're not able to use `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`, there is
another way of declaring a `contextType` on a class:

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.context.value}</h1>
  }
}
App.contextType = MyContext
```

## Final thoughts

`v16.6.0` of React is packed with some great features. I'm so excited for the
future of this library. It's already a joy to use, but the core team continues
to pump out great work to make our lives so much easier. And with everything
announced at [ReactConf 2018](https://conf.reactjs.org/) last week, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

It's a great time to be a developer working in the React ecosystem. Reach out to
me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jakewies) and let me know what your favorite
new features are!
