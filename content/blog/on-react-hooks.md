On the afternoon of October 25th I hastily shuffled my work to the side and
fired up YouTube, knowing that the ReactConf 2018 keynote was minutes away from
starting. This would be the first conference keynote I watch live, and I wanted
no interruptions. As the next two hours began to unfold I realized I was
witnessing a significant moment for React. An evolution of the library.

Coming off the heels of a
[strong `v16.6.0` release](/blog/whats-new-in-react-16.6.0/), the React core
team announced [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), a feature
proposal that exposes certain capabilities to function components such as state
and lifecycle. These capabilities were previously limited to class components.

You can view the entire keynote along with a follow up talk from
[Ryan Florence](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence) in this
[YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM). If you have 90
minutes to kill I encourage you to watch. 👀

Still here?

Hooks are an **experimental proposal**. Nothing you see or hear on the topic
should be considered final. There is currently an
[open RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68) where you can stay current
on the proposal, and even voice your concerns if you have any.

## What are hooks?

As I stated earlier, **React hooks** are a way for function components to access
certain features previously unavailable to them. The obvious ones being state
and lifecycle. They are **not** to be used in class components.

Here's another definition from the
[React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#but-what-is-a-hook):

> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle
> features from function components.

This is a major shift, both technical and conceptual. However, hooks come with
no breaking changes. They're backwards compatible and opt-in, meaning you as a
developer don't need to use them at all. If that's your prerogative. It's an
impressive selling point.

## What problems do they solve?

The [Motivation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation) section
of the official docs details specific problems that the React core team believes
hooks will solve, so I won't regurgitate those here. However, I do want to add
my own point-of-view.

### Moving away from classes

I've had a strange relationship with classes in JavaScript. Sort of like a
monster in my closet that I refuse to acknowledge. JS is my first programming
language, and I definitely haven't worked with another that has classes in the
traditional sense.

I've heard that classes in JS are _different_ than classes in other languages.
This leaves an empty spot in my brain, as if I need to go figure out what those
differences are. I still haven't.

I've heard that you should avoid classes in JS. In fact, I heard this before I
started working with React at all, so you can imagine my confusion when coming
to the library and realizing that classes were fundamental.

The introduction of hooks is an indicator that the core team sees value in
function components over the long term, and there are
[clear reasons](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#classes-confuse-both-people-and-machines)
to prefer them over class components. That being said, I don't think we will see
class components phased out any time soon, if ever. This would go against
React's seemingly backwards compatible mindset. Imagine all of the code that
would be affected by such a change!

### Long live the function!

The longer I do this whole programming thing the more I discover about myself.
One of those discoveries is that I _love_ writing functions. It doesn't matter
the language.

I once read (and didn't finish) an oft-cited book in the realm of programming
called
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).
It comes with a slew of example code that you can work through in
[Scheme](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)>), a
dialect of the Lisp programming language. It was my first _real_ introduction to
the functional programming paradigm, and _man_ was it cool. I loved it. I should
finish that book someday. 🤔

I digress. Where were we? Ah yes, _functions_. Building user interfaces with
functions as my building blocks seems to make a whole lot of sense. The
composibility is there. The developer experience just feels right. I lose that
feeling when I'm trying to refactor some voluminous class in my codebase.

## Wrapping up

The most intriguing part about all of this is that hooks themselves are _just
functions_! The
[official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#its-hard-to-reuse-stateful-logic-between-components)
state that reusing stateful logic is one of the motiviations of hooks. The
ability to wrap up state and all related functionality into bite-sized functions
is going to be such a powerful pattern.

I saw a great tweet in
[a post](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889)
from [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) that further harps on this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;You can npm install an even greater percentage of your application code than before&quot; is, I think, going to be a significant selling point for Hooks.</p>&mdash; Laurie Voss voted, did you? (@seldo) <a href="https://twitter.com/seldo/status/1057030727512911874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2018</a></blockquote>

And not only will hooks make our code more reusable, but it will have a dramatic
impact on the component tree. Imagine all of those providers, all of those
render props and higher-order components slowly washing away. What a beautiful
thought.
