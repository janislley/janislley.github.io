Depending on when you are reading this post, the design of this site could be
anything. Who knows how long this thing will be live? You might be reading this
a thousand years from now.

At present moment the design is in its infant stage. A small blog built with
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static-site generator written in Go. A few people
have inquired about the design over the last few months. Enough to get me
thinking about turning it into something more than what it is. A Hugo Theme,
perhaps?

Yes, Hugo has [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Some really good ones. Some
terribly bad ones. Now mine lives among them. I'm calling it "Codex". Because,
Da Vinci. You can find the code to the theme
[here](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex). It too is in its infant
stage and needs some TLC.

You can start using by entering this at your project root:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex.git themes/codex
```

And if you have any suggestions / want to contribute to make the theme better
please do!
