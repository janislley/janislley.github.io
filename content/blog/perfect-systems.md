It's fashionable to label oneself as a **Type-A** personality.
[Wikipedia describes these individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory)
as _competitive, highly organized, ambitious, impatient, highly aware of time
management and/or aggressive_. Being that I am a trendy member of society, I
identify as Type-A, sans aggressive. These traits serve me well, but each of
them are a double-edged sword.

Consider competitiveness. A quality that drives me, pushes me to be a better
version of myself, fuels me through difficult training sessions. I can spot
another competitor out of a group of ten phonies. There's a mystical aura about
us. We'll be the ones covered in goosebumps watching

I would not be where I am without it.

Competitiveness doesn't come without a cost. It has led to tunnel vision,
preventing me from seeing the forest for the trees. It has provoked countless
fights between friends and family, with words and emotions manifesting like
unwelcome ghosts. It has caused injury from pushing too hard and not knowing
when to ease off the gas pedal. It has spurred me to sound like the smartest
person in the room, even when I am not educated on the topic at hand.

Each of the qualities above enable positive action, but lacking control in any
one of them can lead to less than ideal results.

## The cost of perfection

Imagine the following scenario. Your home world is under attack by a group of
vicious aliens from a far-off galaxy. They're hell-bent on wiping our species
off the map. All the greatest minds have come together in one room to devise a
plan of action. The world depends on them.

Each of them believe they have the perfect solution. None of them can find
common ground. For days they engage in discussions over whose plan is the best.
Meanwhile, The War Of The Worlds rages on. Buildings are crashing down all
around them. The planet is crumbling, and as we look to the greatest minds for
help, we are met with indecision. They have yet to find the perfect plan and
refuse to make a move.

This is a contrived example of what goes through my mind each time I plan my
attack on a goal. It feels productive to consider all possible outcomes. To have
all my bases covered. But the truth is that I'm just hiding from the work.

An ambitious goal can draw out the best in us, but if we require a perfect
system before we set forth to accomplish it, our feet will never leave the
ground. The reality is that _the perfect system does not exist_. Only the right
system for you and your goal, and it will not reveal itself so long as you stand
still. So begin. Move forward. Experiment. Fail. Iterate.

Your system is out there waiting to be discovered.
