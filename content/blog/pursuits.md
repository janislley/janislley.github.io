There is something poetic about pursuing goals without letting the world in on
the journey. It’s actually quite stoic. Think of learning to play the guitar
every night for years. Alone in your room. One day you emerge with a skill that
nobody knew you had. They’ll say, “I didn’t know you could play the guitar?”

I believe that pursuing a goal is a private matter. No explanation needed. But a
pursuit of any kind is still a pursuit. And there are metaphysical properties
that revolve around those who choose to embark on such a quest.

The lessons learned are valuable, whether you learn to play a guitar or decide
you want to be a master hand balancer. These lessons bind us together, and teach
us how to face a common foe: resistance.

This is the _pièce de ré·sis·tance_ of
[Simple Machine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPW7EPRHF4Eb1Ei9I5Gf6A). To
document a journey. To reveal the lessons learned, the failures experienced and
the progress made. To inspire and educate.

There are those who will find themselves reading
[Simple Machine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPW7EPRHF4Eb1Ei9I5Gf6A)
because they share many of the same pursuits as myself. I expect that to be the
case 9 times out of 10. But I also hope that this project will reach others who
care not about the outcomes of my pursuits, but the journey of pursuit itself.
