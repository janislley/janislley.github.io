I'm spending about 4 hours each day live coding on Twitch. This is something
I've wanted to do for a while, and as of late I have some free time! If you want
to check out the streams, you can do so on
[my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/jakewies), where I go live Monday - Friday
at 8:30am to 12:30pm EST.
